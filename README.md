# Conformance Tests for Rust (CTRS)

This is an implementation-independent test suite for The [Rust]
Programming Language. It is intended as a regression test for
the reference implementation, as well as a tool for testing
conformance of alternate implementations.

It differs from the RI test suite in several ways:

* It only covers stable features.
* It has a simple implementation-independent test runner.
* It draws test cases from a wide range of sources.
* It categorizes test cases by language revision, so that multiple
  levels of conformance may be established.

CTRS is not a curated test of the specification - this probably isn't
code you want to read for fun. Rather, it is simply a massive corpus
of valid Rust code that is known work against the reference
compiler. The test suite will evolve over time as bugs are shaken
out of the RI.

Execute with `./run.py` to test your Rust compiler.
Set the `RUSTC` environment variable if you must.

## Criteria for inclusion

Criteria will expand over time.
Currently:

* Must pass 'rustc -F deprecated -F unstable_features'
* Must pass 'rustc -F deprecated -F unstable_features --test'
* No 'extern crate' (i.e. only std)
* Single-file test cases only

Run `./stab.py` on a Rust file to see if it is a candidate.

## Organization

All tests are under the `test` directory. Immediately under `test` are
directories for Rust language/compiler versions. Under each version
are directories for test 'groups'. Test groups are drawn from many
sources, and are licensed individually.

## Current coverage

Current focus is pulling tests out of the reference implementation that
meet the criteria, as well as sourcing single-file examples from
other places.

## Compiler interface requirements

Running the test suite requires a Rust compiler that generally behaves
like the reference compiler. Currently the test suite expects the
compiler to support the `-o` flag. In the future it will expect more
flags to work.

## Licensing

Any OSI-approved license accepted. Non-free licenses also welcome, but
in another repo.

The way this is tracked currently is in a LICENSE file in each
directory of code that didn't originate from The Rust Project itself,
along with an ORIGIN file indicating where it came from.

## Scripts

This test suite is a bunch of python scripts for wrangling Rust code
from various places and into a form that is runnable.

* `dupes.py` - Lists files in the repo with identical hashes.
* `delete_dupes.py` - Deletes duplicates from git.
* `run.py` - The test suite runner. Just needs a `rustc` command
  available or the `RUSTC` environment variable to be set.
* `slurp.py` - Copies all Rust files that pass `stab.py` from one dir to another.
* `slurp_docs.py` - Extracts stable docs from one dir to another.
* `undoc_dir.py` - Recursively extracts doc tests from all .rs/.md files to a dir.
* `stab.py` - Checks whether a crate meets the criteria for inclusion.
* `undoc.py` - Extracts doc tests from a single file.

## Future directions

* Improve accuracy of staby.py
* Add support for reference compile-fail tests
* Support aux-build tests
* Support should-panic doc tests
* Support run-fail tests
* Add support for Makefile tests?
* FFI tests, like rust_test_helpers
* Sources
  * compile-fail, run-fail, run-make tests
  * In-tree std crate docs

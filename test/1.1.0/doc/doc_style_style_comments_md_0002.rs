fn main() {
    Sets up a default runtime configuration, given compiler-supplied arguments.        This function will block until the entire pool of M:N schedulers has    exited. This function also requires a local thread to be available.        Arguments        * `argc` & `argv` - The argument vector. On Unix this information is used                        by `os::args`.    * `main` - The initial procedure to run inside of the M:N scheduling pool.               Once this procedure exits, the scheduling pool will begin to shut               down. The entire pool (and this function) will only return once               all child threads have finished executing.        Return value        The return value is used as the process return code. 0 on success, 101 on    error.}
